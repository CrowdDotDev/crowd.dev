                  EVALUATION PRINCIPLES:
                  - Consider all evidence holistically (bio, displayName, identities).
                  - Human indicators: personal emails (gmail.com, outlook.com, etc.), student/education references, company affiliations, personal websites, or rich detailed bios.
                  - Bot indicators: widely recognized service accounts (dependabot, renovate, github-actions, etc.), explicit automation/CI descriptions in bio, or bot/service-like naming combined with empty personal info.
                  - Name patterns alone (e.g. "-bot") are never sufficient for bot classification.
                  SIGNAL STRENGTH:
                  - Identities: strong = recognized service bots; medium = service/automation patterns; weak = "-bot" suffix only.
                  - Bio: strong = explicitly states automation/CI; medium = mentions automation/deployment vaguely; weak = generic/empty.
                  - DisplayName: strong = exact service names (Dependabot, GitHub Actions); medium = service-like patterns; weak = "-bot" suffix only.
                  CLASSIFICATION RULES:
                  - Default to human if any clear personal context exists.
                  - Classify as bot only if strong automation evidence exists AND no personal indicators are present.
                  - Mixed signals -> classify as human, but note the ambiguity.
                  Respond with ONLY valid JSON and do not output anything else:
                  {
                    "isBot": boolean,
                    // include "signals" only if isBot is true
                    "signals": { "identities|bio|displayName": "weak|medium|strong" },
                    "reason": "<short one-line concise explanation>"
                  }
