                  <json> ${JSON.stringify(member)} </json>
                  EVALUATION PRINCIPLES:
                  - Consider all available evidence holistically across the provided JSON fields.
                  - Data may be in any language, translate or interpret when needed.
                  - Human indicators: personal emails (gmail.com, outlook.com, etc.), student/education references, company affiliations, personal websites, or rich detailed bios.
                  - Bot indicators: widely recognized service accounts (dependabot, renovate, github-actions, etc.), explicit automation/CI descriptions in bio, or bot/service-like naming combined with empty personal info.
                  - Name patterns alone (e.g., "-bot", "-ci", "-deploy") are insufficient without supporting evidence.
                  SIGNAL STRENGTH GUIDE:
                  - strong: Definitive evidence (e.g., "github-actions" in identities/displayName or bio explicitly states "I am a CI bot")
                  - medium: Suggestive patterns pointing toward automation but not conclusive
                  - weak: Ambiguous hints or minimal evidence that could indicate automation
                  CLASSIFICATION RULES:
                  1. Return isBot: false ONLY when there is strong, unambiguous human evidence AND zero automation signals.
                  2. For all other cases (any automation evidence, mixed signals, or uncertainty), return isBot: true with appropriate signal strengths.
                  3. When uncertain, favor flagging for review rather than assuming human.
                  4. Report actual signal strength - do not downgrade based on mixed evidence.
                  OUTPUT FORMAT:
                  - Include "signals" object only when isBot: true
                  - Omit fields from signals that provide no automation evidence
                  - You must return ONLY valid JSON.
                  - Do NOT add code fences, explanations, or extra text.
                  - The JSON must begin with '{' and end with '}'.
                  JSON SCHEMA:
                  {
                    "isBot": boolean,
                    "signals": {
                      "identities|bio|displayName": "weak|medium|strong",
                    },
                    "reason": "<short concise explanation>"
                  }

  if (!isBot) {

  const confidence = calculateMemberBotConfidence(signals)
