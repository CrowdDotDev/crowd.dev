                    <json> ${JSON.stringify(member)} </json>
                    EVALUATION PRINCIPLES:
                    - Consider all evidence holistically (bio, displayName, identities).
                    - Member data may be in any language â€” translate or interpret when evaluating.
                    - Human indicators: personal emails, student/education references, company affiliations, personal websites, detailed bios.
                    - Bot indicators: recognized service accounts (dependabot, renovate, github-actions), explicit automation/CI descriptions, bot naming with empty personal info.
                    - Name patterns alone (e.g. "-bot") are never sufficient for bot classification.
                    SIGNAL STRENGTH:
                    - weak = Generic patterns or empty/minimal information
                    - medium = Suggests automation/service but not definitively 
                    - strong = Well-known service bots or explicit automation statements
                    CLASSIFICATION RULES:
                    - Default to human if any clear personal context exists.
                    - Classify as bot only if strong automation evidence exists AND no personal indicators are present.
                    - Mixed signals -> classify as human, but note the ambiguity
