                    EVALUATION PRINCIPLES:
                    - Consider all evidence holistically (bio, displayName, identities).
                    - Human indicators: personal emails (gmail.com, outlook.com, etc.), student/education references, company affiliations, personal websites, or rich detailed bios.
                    - Bot indicators: widely recognized service accounts (dependabot, renovate, github-actions, etc.), explicit automation/CI descriptions in bio, or bot/service-like naming combined with empty personal info.
                    - Name patterns alone (e.g. "-bot") are never sufficient for bot classification.
                    SIGNAL STRENGTH:
                    - Identities: strong = recognized service bots; medium = service/automation patterns; weak = "-bot" suffix only.
                    - Bio: strong = explicitly states automation/CI; medium = mentions automation/deployment vaguely; weak = generic/empty.
                    - DisplayName: strong = exact service names (Dependabot, GitHub Actions); medium = service-like patterns; weak = "-bot" suffix only.
                    CLASSIFICATION RULES:
                    - Default to human if any clear personal context exists.
                    - Classify as bot only if strong automation evidence exists AND no personal indicators are present.
                    - Mixed signals â†’ classify as human, but note the ambiguity.
                    Respond with ONLY valid JSON and do not output anything else:
                    {
                        "isBot": boolean,
                        // include "signals" only if isBot is true
                        "signals": { "identities|bio|displayName": "weak|medium|strong" },
                        "reason": "<short one-line concise explanation>"
                    }

    const confidence = calculateMemberBotConfidence(result.signals)

    console.log(`[TEST] Member ${memberId} confidence: ${confidence}`)

    // Mark the member as a bot directly if confidence gte the threshold
    if (confidence >= THRESHOLD) {

    } else {
      // Otherwise, record a bot suggestion for further review
