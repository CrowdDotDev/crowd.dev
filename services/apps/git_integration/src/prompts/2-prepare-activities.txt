## Activities and members in crowd.dev

We have a method to add activities with their activity member in crowd.dev. This is how it would look for the authored commit activity:

```jsx
[
	{
		type: 'authored-commit',
		timestamp: '2022-02-02',
		sourceId: '7b50567bdcad8925ca1e075feb7171c12015afd1'
		platform: 'git',
		channel: 'torvalds/linux',
		attributes: {
			insertions: 7,
			deletions: 1,
			lines: 6,
			isMerge: false,
			isMainBranch: true,
			branches: ['master']
		},
		url: 'git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git',
		member: {
			userName: 'Arnd Bergmann',
			displayName: 'Arnd Bermann',
			emails: ['[*arnd@arndb.de](mailto:arnd@arndb.de)'*]
		}
	},
	... other activities
]
```

- `type`: the activity type: *authored-commit*, *signed-off-commit*, *reviewed-commit*, *committed-commit*, *reported-commit*…,
- `channel`: this is the repo
- `url`: the git remote
- `member`: information about the community member.
- `sourceId`: see below

### Activity types

We can always make the activity type from the commit message by removing the `-by` from the message and adding `-commit`

- `Co-authored-by` → `co-authored-commit`
- `Signed-off-by` → `signed-off-commit`

authored-commit and commited-commit are implicit and should always be generated from the commit.

### Activities and IDs

Activities have two important ID fields

- `sourceId`
    - The id of the activity on the source. Source IDs have to be unique, and they are very important to handle deduplication in crowd.dev.
    - Authoring a commit will always be the main commit activity, and it is guaranteed to exist. We should always set the `sourceId` of an authored-commit activity to be the commit hash.
    - For all other activities we need to create a unique hash using the commit hash, the activity type, and the member.
- `sourceParentId`
    - The id of the parent activity for activities other than authored-commit. Adding activities like this groups them as *conversations* in crowd.dev.
    - All commit activities that are not authored-commit should have the commit hash as `sourceParentId`
    - The authored commit should have an empty sourceParentId

A function prepare-crowd-activities receives a list of commits as returned by get_new_commits. For each commit it extracts the non-implicit activities. It then returns a list of all the activities in the crowd.dev format above.

++ Prompt

Can you make prepare-crowd-activities?
