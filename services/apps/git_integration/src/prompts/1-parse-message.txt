The message of a commit includes lines from which activites have to be extracted. The lines are like this:

In order to extract the activities we need to find the activity name (the text before :). An ActivityMap dictionary maps a lower-case version of the activity name to the activities that need to be registered. It looks like this:

ActivityMap = {
	"about-fscking-timed-by":                 {"Reviewed-by"},
		"accked-by":                              {"Reviewed-by"},
		"aced-by":                                {"Reviewed-by"},
		"ack":                                    {"Reviewed-by"},
		"ack-by":                                 {"Reviewed-by"},
		"ackde-by":                               {"Reviewed-by"},
		"acked":                                  {"Reviewed-by"},
		"acked-and-reviewed":                     {"Reviewed-by"},
		"acked-and-reviewed-by":                  {"Reviewed-by"},
		"acked-and-tested-by":                    {"Reviewed-by", "Tested-by"}
        ...
        }

We parse the lines of the message in order to extract the activities from the activity names that may be found. The activity names are hand-written and can have typos. An activity may happen several times in a commit, and we want to capture all of them. For each activity occurrence we want the name and email of the person who made it, extracted form the string after the :

A function extract_activities extracts the activities from the message of a commit, and returns a list of activities. Each activity in the list includes the activity and the person who made it, which in turn includes the name and the email.

+# Prompt

Can you make this function.
