/**
 * Member Data Erasure Script (Tinybird Analytics Platform)
 *
 * This script removes member data from Tinybird datasources for GDPR compliance
 * and data deletion requests. It complements the database deletion script by
 * cleaning up analytical data stored in Tinybird.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES:
 * 1. Shows a detailed summary of records to be deleted from each Tinybird datasource
 * 2. Requests user confirmation before proceeding
 * 3. Deletes data from Tinybird datasources in the correct order to respect dependencies
 * 4. Handles special cases like maintainersInternal which requires identityId-based deletion
 *
 * TINYBIRD INTEGRATION:
 * Uses "Delete Data Selectively" API from Tinybird:
 * https://www.tinybird.co/docs/classic/get-data-in/data-operations/replace-and-delete-data#delete-data-selectively
 *
 * DATASOURCES AFFECTED (in deletion order):
 * 1. activityRelations - Activity relationship records (deleted by memberId)
 * 2. members - Member profile data (deleted by memberId)
 * 3. maintainersInternal - Repository maintainer records (deleted by identityId from member's identities)
 * 4. memberIdentities - Member identity records (deleted by memberId)
 *
 * FOREIGN KEY HANDLING:
 * - maintainersInternal.identityId â†’ memberIdentities.id
 *   Solution: Use subquery in delete condition - 'identityId IN (SELECT id FROM memberIdentities WHERE memberId = ?)'
 *
 * DOWNSTREAM EFFECTS:
 * All datasources created from pipes based on these tables will reflect the deletions
 * after the relevant copy pipes run (typically scheduled hourly).
 *
 * USAGE:
 *   npm run script erase-members-data-tinybird <memberId> <tinybirdToken>
 *
 * REQUIREMENTS:
 * - Tinybird token must be provided as command line argument
 * - Token must have delete permissions on the specified datasources
 *
 * SAFETY FEATURES:
 * - Shows detailed deletion summary with record counts before proceeding
 * - Requires explicit user confirmation (Y/n)
 * - Graceful error handling for API failures
 * - Special validation for maintainersInternal dependencies
