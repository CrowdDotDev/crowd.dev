/**
 * Member Data Erasure Script (Database)
 *
 * This script completely removes a member and all associated data from the database
 * for GDPR compliance and data deletion requests. It performs a comprehensive cleanup
 * across multiple related tables while respecting foreign key constraints.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES:
 * 1. Shows a detailed summary of all data to be deleted/modified
 * 2. Requests user confirmation before proceeding
 * 3. Performs the following operations in order:
 *    - Archives member identities to requestedForErasureMemberIdentities (separate step)
 *    - Deletes from maintainersInternal (respects FK constraint with memberIdentities)
 *    - Deletes from all member-related tables (relations, segments, etc.)
 *    - Deletes the main member record
 *    - Triggers search index updates and organization re-sync
 *
 * FOREIGN KEY HANDLING:
 * - maintainersInternal.identityId â†’ memberIdentities.id
 *   Solution: Delete maintainersInternal records first before memberIdentities
 *
 * TABLES AFFECTED:
 * - maintainersInternal (deleted by identityId from member's identities)
 * - requestedForErasureMemberIdentities (memberIdentities are inserted here before deletion)
 * - activityRelations, memberNoMerge, memberOrganizationAffiliationOverrides
 * - memberOrganizations, memberSegmentAffiliations, memberSegments, memberSegmentsAgg
 * - memberEnrichmentCache, memberEnrichments, memberIdentities
 * - memberToMerge, memberToMergeRaw, memberBotSuggestions, memberNoBot
 * - members (main record)
 *
 * SEARCH INDEX UPDATES:
 * - Removes member from search indexes
 * - Re-syncs any affected organizations
 *
 * USAGE:
 *   npm run script erase-member <memberId>
 *
 * SAFETY FEATURES:
 * - Shows detailed deletion summary before proceeding
 * - Requires explicit user confirmation (Y/n)
 * - Runs in a database transaction for atomicity
 * - Comprehensive error handling and logging
