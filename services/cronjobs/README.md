The directories here contain code that is meant to run periodically and doesn't require the complexity of Temporal.

The first service (archived_repositories) is an asynchronous task that uses [BullMQ](https://bullmq.io/) as an 
asynchronous task runner. If we want to get fancy, we can install a dashboard for BullMQ. There are a few of them, like 
[this](https://github.com/felixmosh/bull-board), [this](https://github.com/bee-queue/arena), and 
[this](https://taskforce.sh/).

It runs using Kubernetes cron jobs but could also easily run using systemd jobs, or even plain old cron jobs (the latter 
seem to have their days numbered, though; Most Linux distributions are deprecating them, and some don't even ship cron
anymore).

It can serve as an example for other simple cron jobs that also don't need Temporal.
