DESCRIPTION >
    - `pull_requests_review_time_by_size.pipe` serves the "Development - Review time by pull request size" widget.
    - Analyzes the correlation between PR size (measured by git changed lines) and review time.
    - Groups PRs by size buckets ('1-9', '10-59', '60-99', '100-499', '500+') and calculates average review time for each.
    - Excludes PRs without size information (`not empty(gitChangedLinesBucket)`) to ensure accurate analysis.
    - Primary use case: understanding how PR size impacts review efficiency and identifying optimal PR sizing.
    - Parameters:
    - `project`: Required string for project slug (e.g., 'k8s', 'tensorflow') - inherited from `pull_requests_filtered`
    - `repos`: Optional array of repository URLs for filtering (inherited from `pull_requests_filtered`)
    - `startDate`: Optional DateTime filter for PRs reviewed after timestamp (e.g., '2024-01-01 00:00:00')
    - `endDate`: Optional DateTime filter for PRs reviewed before timestamp (e.g., '2024-12-31 23:59:59')
    - Response: `gitChangedLinesBucket`, `reviewedInSecondsAvg`, `pullRequestCount` ordered by size bucket
