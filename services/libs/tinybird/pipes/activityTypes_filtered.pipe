DESCRIPTION >
    - `activityTypes_filtered.pipe` allows filtering activityTypes from the respective data source.
    - By default, this only returns code contribution activities (`includeCodeContributions = 1`).
    - To return all activities, set `includeCodeContributions = 1`, `includeCollaborations = 1`, and `includeOtherContributions = 1`.
    - Parameters:
    - `includeCodeContributions`: Optional boolean to include code contribution activities. Defaults to 1. Set to 0 to exclude.
    - `includeCollaborations`: Optional boolean to include or exclude collaboration activities.
    - `includeOtherContributions`: Optional boolean to include other contribution activities (activities that are neither code contributions nor collaborations).
    - Response: `activityType`, `platform`.
    - This pipe is used by other downstream pipes as an auxiliary method of filtering data by activity types.
