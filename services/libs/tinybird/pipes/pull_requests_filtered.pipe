DESCRIPTION >
    - `pull_requests_filtered.pipe` is the core filtering infrastructure for pull request analytics across the platform.
    - Provides consistent, reusable PR filtering logic for all pull request-related widgets and analytics.
    - Uses `pull_requests_analyzed` datasource which contains pre-calculated PR metrics and timing data.
    - Automatically scopes data to the current project using `segments_filtered` pipe for security and data isolation.
    - Supports repository-level filtering for targeted PR analysis within projects.
    - Primary use case: serving as the foundation for all PR analytics pipes including lead times, review metrics, and velocity analysis.
    - Parameters:
    - `project`: Required string for project slug (e.g., 'k8s', 'tensorflow') - inherited from `segments_filtered`
    - `repos`: Optional array of repository URLs for filtering PRs by specific repositories (e.g., ['https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes'])
    - Response: All fields from `pull_requests_analyzed` including PR metadata, timing metrics, and calculated fields
