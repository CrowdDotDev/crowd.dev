DESCRIPTION >
    - `organization_dependency.pipe` serves the organization dependency widget showing organizations that make up majority of project contributions.
    - Identifies organizations whose combined contributions reach or exceed 51% of total project activity (institutional bus factor analysis).
    - Uses running total calculation to find the minimum set of organizations representing majority contribution share.
    - Combines data from `organizations_leaderboard` and `active_organizations` to provide institutional dependency risk assessment.
    - Primary use case: measuring project sustainability from organizational perspective and identifying key institutional dependencies.
    - Parameters:
    - `project`: Required string for project slug (e.g., 'k8s', 'tensorflow') - inherited from `organizations_leaderboard`
    - `repos`: Optional array of repository URLs for filtering (inherited from `organizations_leaderboard`)
    - `startDate`: Optional DateTime filter for activities after timestamp (e.g., '2024-01-01 00:00:00')
    - `endDate`: Optional DateTime filter for activities before timestamp (e.g., '2024-12-31 23:59:59')
    - `repos`: Optional array of repository URLs (e.g., ['https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes'])
    - `platform`: Optional string filter for source platform (e.g., 'github', 'discord', 'slack')
    - `activity_type`: Optional string filter for single activity type (e.g., 'authored-commit')
    - `activity_types`: Optional array of activity types (e.g., ['authored-commit', 'co-authored-commit'])
    - `onlyContributions`: Optional boolean, defaults to 1 (contributions only), set to 0 for all activities
    - Response: `id`, `displayName`, `contributionPercentage`, `contributionPercentageRunningTotal`, `totalOrganizationCount`
