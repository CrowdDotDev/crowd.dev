DESCRIPTION >
    - `activityRepositories_filtered.pipe` provides repository-level filtering and metadata by unnesting repositories from project definitions.
    - Transforms project-level repository arrays into individual repository records that can be filtered and searched independently.
    - Each repository is returned with its associated project metadata (projectId, projectName, projectSlug) for context.
    - **Mainly used by `search_collections_projects_repos` pipe** by providing repository search functionality through the `search` parameter.
    - Parameters:
    - `repos`: Optional array of repository URLs to filter results (e.g., ['https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes'])
    - `search`: Optional string for partial repository URL matching with wildcard support (e.g., 'kubernetes')
    - `projectSlug`: Optional string to filter repositories by specific project slug (e.g., 'k8s')
    - Response: `projectId`, `projectName`, `projectSlug`, and `repo` (repository URL) for each repository in matching projects.
