DESCRIPTION >
    - `search_collections_projects_repos.pipe` serves the unified search widget for collections, projects, and repositories.
    - Performs search across three entity types using shared `search` parameter and returns up to configurable results per type.
    - Combines results from `collections_filtered`, `insightsProjects_filtered`, and `activityRepositories_filtered` pipes.
    - Filters out inactive projects (with 0 organizations and 0 contributors) to ensure relevant search results.
    - Orders results by relevance: collections by project count, projects by contributor count, repositories alphabetically.
    - Primary use case: powering global search functionality and autocomplete dropdowns across the platform.
    - Parameters:
    - `search`: Required string for searching across all entity types (inherited by filtered pipes)
    - `limit`: Optional integer for result limit per entity type, defaults to 10
    - Response: `type` ('collection'|'project'|'repository'), `slug`, `logo`, `projectSlug`, `name`
