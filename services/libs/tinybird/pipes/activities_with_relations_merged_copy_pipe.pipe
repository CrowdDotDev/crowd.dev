DESCRIPTION >
    Merges activities and its relations together. This copy pipe runs in append mode, meaning only the activities that were updated recently (last hour) will be merged together again. This means that for change done in this pipe, the bash script called `run_activity_merge_copy_pipe` under `services/libs/tinybird/scripts/` need to be run. The script runs this copy pipe in daily batches, backfilling and merging activities and relations together. Destination datasource's sorting keys are optimized for the following deduplication operation.
