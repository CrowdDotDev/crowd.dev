DESCRIPTION >
    - `pull_requests_average_resolve_velocity.pipe` serves the "Avg velocity" portion of the "Development - Pull Requests" widget.
    - Calculates the average time in seconds to resolve pull requests for filtered activities.
    - Only includes PRs that have been resolved (`isNotNull(pra.resolvedAt)`) to ensure accurate velocity calculations.
    - Primary use case: displaying average PR resolution time metrics in development health dashboards.
    - Parameters:
    - `project`: Required string for project slug (e.g., 'k8s', 'tensorflow') - inherited from `segments_filtered`
    - `repos`: Optional array of repository URLs for filtering (inherited from `segments_filtered`)
    - `startDate`: Optional DateTime filter for activities after timestamp (e.g., '2024-01-01 00:00:00')
    - `endDate`: Optional DateTime filter for activities before timestamp (e.g., '2024-12-31 23:59:59')
    - `repos`: Optional array of repository URLs (e.g., ['https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes'])
    - `platform`: Optional string filter for source platform (e.g., 'github', 'discord', 'slack')
    - `activity_type`: Optional string filter for single activity type (e.g., 'authored-commit')
    - `activity_types`: Optional array of activity types (e.g., ['authored-commit', 'co-authored-commit'])
    - `onlyContributions`: Optional boolean, defaults to 1 (contributions only), set to 0 for all activities
    - Response: `averagePullRequestResolveVelocitySeconds` (average resolution time in seconds)
