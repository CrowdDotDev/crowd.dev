    - `issues_analyzed` contains analyzed issue lifecycle data with open/close timestamps and resolution durations.
    - Created via copy pipe with computed duration metrics for issue performance analysis.
    - Tracks issue resolution velocity and patterns across projects and repositories.
    - `id` is the unique identifier for the analyzed issue record.
    - `sourceId` is the external identifier from the source platform (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).
    - `segmentId` links to the project segment this issue belongs to.
    - `channel` contains the repository where the issue was created.
    - `platform` is the source platform (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).
