DESCRIPTION >
    - `segmentsAggregatedMV` is a materialized view containing pre-computed contributor and organization counts per segment.
    - Uses AggregatingMergeTree engine for efficient aggregation storage and querying.
    - Provides fast access to segment-level statistics without real-time computation.
    - `segmentId` is the project segment identifier being aggregated.
    - `contributorCount` is an aggregate function storing distinct contributor counts for the segment.
    - `organizationCount` is an aggregate function storing distinct organization counts for the segment.
