### üöÄ Features

#### Pricing and feature flagging

We are getting ready to make pricing possible so we can continue building crowd.dev for you. This week we introduced our infrastructure for pricing. You can check the full pricing details on our [website](https://crowd.dev/pricing). All tenants have been set to a free trial of the growth plan, which lasts until the 15th of January. After that, you will need to get a subscription to access the growth features.

With this, we have introduced feature flagging, so we can also roll out features gradually, with more testing and performance.

## v0.10.1 - 2022-11-30

### Changes

This release introduces three new features: organizations, tasks, and notes. Furthermore, we added a bunch of bug fixes and improvements based on your feedback.

### :rocket: Features

#### Organizations

You can now track how organizations are adopting your community. With the organizations' list, you can have an overview of all organizations. You can also have several views and perform filtering. For each organization, there is an organization page with all its background information, a list of all the members that belong to the organization, and their activities.
<img width="700" alt="Organizations" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37874460/204589538-65a46d85-ec91-488a-9b32-45f48fe53a94.png">

#### Tasks

With the new tasks feature you can create tasks related to your community members. Do you want to ask newcomers for feedback? Or influential members for some recognition? Or an unhappy member how can you make their life easier? You can orchestrate all this with your team using tasks. We support all standard to-do features, like assigning them to colleagues and setting due dates. You can read more in our [tasks docs](https://docs.crowd.dev/docs/tasks).
<img width="700" alt="Tasks" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37874460/204589346-6172b211-76fc-427c-9be2-9f5859756088.png">

#### Notes

The notes module allows you to add notes to your community members. You can annotate your chats with the member and leave comments for your colleagues. Oh, and we support markdown!

### Bug fixes and improvements

The feedback has been tremendous after our open-source launch! We have spent this month working on many bug fixes and improvements to make the app better every single day.

## v0.9.0 - 2022-10-31

### Changes

:fire: A brand-new user interface.
We completely overhauled our design and user experience (you may not even recognize the app). crowd.dev is now much more intuitive to use, and the product feels more polished.

<img width="1103" alt="Screenshot 2022-10-28 at 15 51 31" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37874460/198659098-cf43074c-1607-41a5-adf7-47635e247639.png">
:bust_in_silhouette: Richer member profiles
Member profiles now show you everything you need to know about an individual in one place, with even richer information on their activity history, tags, engagement level, and much more.
:man-man-boy-boy: Information on represented organizations
We now show you the total organizations that have been identified in your community, we also update you on any new organizations that are popping up in your community, as well as show you all the active organizations (organizations where members have been active in a given time period). Expect standalone pages for organizations very soon.
:dart:  Powerful filters, sorts, and views
Our new powerful filters, sorts and views instantly help you to segment, research, and understand your community more effectively. We have included default views, for example, ‚Äúslipping away‚Äù to identify valuable members that may need some extra attention or ‚Äúinfluential‚Äù to find individuals with high reach.
:thermometer: Sentiment analysis
We‚Äôve built a model to conduct sentiment analysis for all activities in your community to show you how members are feeling, so you can take informed actions.
:love_letter: Trending conversations
We help you keep track of all conversations going on in your community, now, we also show you the ones that are trending and pulling a lot of engagement.

:hammer_and_wrench: Custom attributes and identities
Use our custom attribute function to add specific to you details as well as extra identities for your members beyond their community profiles (e.g., you can add identities using their phone number or extra email).

:key: Social Sign in with Google
We‚Äôve added social sign-in to make signing up and logging into [crowd.dev](http://crowd.dev/) a breeze. You can now use your Google account.

#### Breaking changes

This version introduces breaking API changes. While the API has vastly improved and it is now much more powerful, previous scripts written with the API will need to be adjusted. For more information, refer to the [API docs](https://docs.crowd.dev/reference).
