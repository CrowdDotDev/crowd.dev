# LFX Community Management (fka crowd.dev) 
## Background story
This project was launched as part of the startup crowd.dev. crowd.dev was acquired by the Linux Foundation in April 2024. Following the acquisition, crowd.dev was renamed to "Community Management" and is now part of the [LFX platform](https://lfx.linuxfoundation.org/).

## About this project
LFX Community Management is a Customer Data Platform (CDP) that collects and stores customer data from across the communities in a single database for data unification, identity resolution, analysis, and activation. By utilizing this tool, the Linux Foundation can effectively identify key contributors and organizations, facilitating more efficient community support.

Key features:
* It consolidates developers' touchpoints with a company or brand.
* It captures data from community platforms, product channels, and commercial channels.
* The data is cleaned, and profiles are matched across platforms and enriched with third-party data.
* The platform provides a unified 360-degree view of developers' engagement, their companies, and their customer journey.
