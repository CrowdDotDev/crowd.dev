## About Sphere
Sphere (getsphere.dev) is a community-driven fork of the crowd.dev project. Sphere is a Developer Data Platform (DDP) that allows companies to centralize all touch points developers have with their product and brand, whether in the community (e.g., Stack Overflow or Reddit), product (open-source or SaaS), or commercial channels (e.g., HubSpot). The platform pulls data from various sources, normalizes it, matches identities across platforms, and enriches it with third-party data. The result is a unified 360-degree view of the developers who engage with your product and community, the companies they work for, and their position in their personal customer journey.

Sphere is open-source, built with developers in mind, available for both hosted and self-hosted deployments, open to extensions, and offers full control over your data.

**To our users:**
- You can get actively involved, contribute to our roadmap, and turn Sphere into the tool you've always wanted.
- We are open about what we are building, allowing you to take a look inside, and ensuring that we handle your data in a privacy-preserving way.
- Our interests as a community are aligned with yours, and we need to ensure that we always deliver enough value to you with our offerings.

**To our developer community:**
- You can self-host Sphere to centralize data for your community or company while keeping full control over your data.
- Our product is built for extensibility. If you can think of any use cases that you want to build with the data we collect and store for you, please go ahead and build them! We will be here to help out if you need us.
- You can actively contribute to Sphere (e.g., integrations), and we will be supporting you along the journey. Just take a look at our [Contributing guide](https://github.com/SphereDev/Sphere/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
