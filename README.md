## About crowd.dev

Crowd.dev is a suite of tools to analyze, grow, and leverage online communities in order to drive business results.

In recent years, community has moved to the forefront of business. But building community is hard. In the beginning, organizations have to continuously find community members and maintain a high engagement among them. Once a community is thriving, organizations are stuck managing endless tools, working with incomplete data, and failing to bring the return of community back to their business.

Crowd.dev is here to change this. Self-hosted or hosted by us, with developers in mind, open to extensions, and with full control over your community's data.

## ‚ú® Features

- Integrate with platforms like GitHub, Discord, Slack, Twitter or DEV to establish a single source of truth for your community
- Get background information about your community members and manage them with tags and automated segmentation
- Detect relevant conversations and publish them in a community help center to reduce duplicate questions and get your community's content listed on search engines <a href="https://open.crowd.dev/crowd">[example]</a>
- Analyze your community, create custom metrics, organize them in reports and share them publicly with your community, your investors, or your team

## üîî Stay up-to-date

Crowd.dev is still in beta and we ship new features every month. To stay in the loop, leave us a star and subscribe to our <a href="https://crowd.dev/newsletter">monthly newsletter</a>. Thanks a lot! ‚ù§Ô∏è

## üöÄ Getting started

### Self-hosted version

#### Deployment

The backend code is deployed to AWS (both static servers and serverless stack). The front-end is serverd through Netlify. The steps are outlined [in our deployment docs](https://docs.crowd.dev/docs/deployment).
